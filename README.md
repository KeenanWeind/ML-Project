# ML-Project
From Kaggle, we obtained a dataset showing scholastic achievement in three categories: Math, Reading, and Writing scores. We checked for a correlation between scores, so as to gauge general aptitude, as it were. First, we ran a linear regression model with the Math scores as our independent variable, and Reading scores as the dependent. A positive slope was generated (with an R squared near 70 %), so it does appear that general aptitude rises along with Math. The null hypothesis would be that the various other permutations of categories would display a similar correlation. After running said permutations, we found that, indeed, there was no real difference (i.e. we failed to disprove the null hypothesis, and our intuition proved true).
